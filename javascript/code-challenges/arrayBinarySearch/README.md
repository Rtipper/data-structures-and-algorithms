# Binary Array Search
Binary search in a sorted 1D array

## Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Create an array
- Indicate a key value
- Run through array
- If key matches element within array, return that value's index
- If the key does not match the array, return -1
