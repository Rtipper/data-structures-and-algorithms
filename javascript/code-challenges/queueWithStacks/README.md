# Stacks and Queues - CC11

## Challenge
CC 11 - Queues with Stacks
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
- Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
- enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
- dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Ensure the node.js is created.
- Utilize the .push(), .pop(), .peek() & .isEmpty() methods as demoed in class, pushing nodes on the stack, popping them off, peeking at the top node and creating a catch if the stack is empty.
- Utilize the .enqueue() and .dequeue() methods within the pseudoqueue class to ensure nodes can be added to the queue as  well as removed from the queue, along with .peek() to see the node at the front of the queue and .isEmpty() in case the queue is empty
- Create a Pseudo Queue class the uses the new structures as outline for CC11

- Create node.js
- Create stack.js -- .push() / .pop() / .peek() / .isEmpty()
- Create pseudoqueue.js -- .enqueue() / .dequeue() / .peek() / .isEmpty()
