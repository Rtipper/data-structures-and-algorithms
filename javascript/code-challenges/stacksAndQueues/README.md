# Stacks and Queues - CC10

## Challenge
CC 10 - Stacks and Queues
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
- Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
- Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Ensure the node.js is created.
- Utilize the .push(), .pop(), .peek() & .isEmpty() methods as demoed in class, pushing nodes on the stack, popping them off, peeking at the top node and creating a catch if the stack is empty.
- Utilize the .enqueue() and .dequeue() methods to ensure nodes can be added to the queue as  well as removed from the queue, along with .peek() to see the node at the front of the queue and .isEmpty() in case the queue is empty

- Create node.js
- Create stack.js -- .push() / .pop() / .peek() / .isEmpty()
- Create queue.js -- .enqueue() / .dequeue() / .peek() / .isEmpty()
