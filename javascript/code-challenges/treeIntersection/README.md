# Tree Intersection | CC32

## Challenge
CC 32 | Tree Intersection

Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.

Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Create and utilize node.js, tree,js, bst.js and tree-intersection.js as main files
- Create function that will take in both BSTs in order to correction intersect their correct values
- Traverse via 2 for loops
- Utilize pre, post and inOrder
