# Bracket Validation - CC13

## Challenge
CC 13 - Bracket Validation
On your main file, createâ€¦
JavaScript: a function called multiBracketValidation(input)

Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

Round Brackets : ()
Square Brackets : []
Curly Brackets : {}

## Approach & Efficiency
- Ensure test is working correctly and displaying both true and false
- Utilize the .push(), .pop() methods for the 3 types of brackets, created as strings

- Create bracketValidition.js -- .push() / .pop()
