# Singly Linked List
Today we are creating our first linked lists based off of the in class demo provided by Brian. Through this, we are taking our first steps into the world of DataStructures and Algorithms and switching gears on the usual app development side of things.

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
---------------
CC6 Update
Refactor to include .append, .insertBefore & .insertAfter.

## Approach & Efficiency
Ref. demo code to ensure that the basic info for what is required for a linked list in implemented.
Create a whiteboard to help with the learning/understanding/scaffolding process
Make sure tests are working locally

## API
- .instert()
- .includes()
- .toString()
- .append()
